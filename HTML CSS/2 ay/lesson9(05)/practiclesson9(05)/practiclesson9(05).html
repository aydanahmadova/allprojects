                                both
                                Micro and Social who are committed to tackling poverty and injustice in their

                            <p>Patient capital is not a grant, it is an investment which is intended to recoup its
                                principal. It would not seek to maximize financial returns on its investment, as we seek
                                to
                                maximize social impact, to capitalize the creation of markets to combat poverty and give
                                an
                                opportunity for growth to both Micro and Social enterprise.</p>
                            <p>With our patient capital program, we as the investor are willing to make a financial
                                investment in a business with no expectation of turning a quick profit, instead
                                investors
                                will demand accountability in the form of return on capital and substantiated proof that
                                the
                                enterprise can grow sustainably in the long run. If we do have a very huge success story
                                to
                                share, we as a team would feel proud of being a part of that success.</p>
                            <p>Each year we aim to invest in 2 projects as a Patient Capital Investor and back these
                                projects with our expertise, business advisory and strategic support, to ensure that
                                they
                                succeed and become self-sustainable. </p>
